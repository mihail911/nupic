[This file not to be distributed with source release -- for NTA use]

This directory contains all libraries used for Numenta software. 
With the exception of the python sub-directory, each directory
contains the source code for a single library of the same name. 


The following steps are necessary to add a new directory/library in nta:

- Create Makefile.am (use one from another directory as a model) in that directory

- Create a unittests subdirectory

- Add the directory and the unittest subdirectory to SUBDIRS in nta/Makefile.am

- In autogen.sh add the unit test directory to the list of directories where 
makefiles are automatically generated. 

- In cleanup.sh add the unit test directory to the list of directories
where Makefile.am is deleted

- In configure.ac add the main Makefile and the unittest Makefile to the list
of Makefiles generated by autoconf

- In qa/testeverything/update_app.py add the directory to the list of directories
for which tests are automatically included
