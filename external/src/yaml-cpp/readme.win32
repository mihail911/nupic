To build for win32 use, make the following modifications to the official files:

parse.vcproj
  Release configuration
    - set the runtime library to Multi-threaded (MT)
      If directly modifying the file this is RuntimeLibrary="0"
    - remove the additional dependency on yamlcpp.lib (it is handled by the project dependencies)
      In directly modifying the file remove the line AdditionalDependencies="yamlcpp.lib"
    
  Debug configuration
    - set the runtime library to Multi-threaded Debug (/MTd)
      If directly modifying the file this is RuntimeLibrary="1"
    - remove the additional dependency on yamlcppd.lib (it is handled by the project dependencies)
      In directly modifying the file remove the line AdditionalDependencies="yamlcppd.lib"

test.vcproj
  Release configuration
    - set the runtime library to Multi-threaded (MT)
      If directly modifying the file this is RuntimeLibrary="0"
    - remove the additional dependency on yamlcpp.lib (it is handled by the project dependencies)

  Debug configuration
    - set the runtime library to Multi-threaded Debug (/MTd)
