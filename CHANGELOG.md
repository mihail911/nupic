# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (in progress)

* Parsing python requirements in setuptools so they are included within published packages (working toward releases).
* Implement logic for reusing segments, to enforce a fixed-size connectivity (nupic.core).
* Added CHANGELOG.md to track changes for versions.
* Added version.txt file to root, read by setuptools to establish version.
